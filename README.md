# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
In this analysis, I perform Chi-Square testing on the given variables. Once realized that the data is undersampled, I perform an upsampling of the training set and use logistic regression, descion tree model, and random forecast to determine the best predictive model. Analysis done in SQL and RStudio. Data set is taken from Kaggle.
