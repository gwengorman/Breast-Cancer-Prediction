# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
In this analysis, I perform Chi-Square testing on the given variables. Once realized that the data is undersampled, I perform an upsampling of the training set and use logistic regression, descion tree model, and random forecast to determine the best predictive model. Analysis done in SQL and RStudio. Data set is taken from Kaggle.<br>

Overall, the Random Forest has an acceptable accuracy of 76%. The model seems to perform moderately well in terms of sensitivity and positive predictive value but less so in terms of specificity and negative predictive value. Overall, we faced some challenges with the original dataset. There were null values, undersampling of dead patients, and undersampling of male patients. The sample size could have also benefited from being larger overall as it only has 317 observations.
